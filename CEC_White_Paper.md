Abstract
A  general public decentralized utility where people can exchange their tokenized power back to a grid at a fair market price without a 3rd party power broker. NFT (Non- Fungible Tokens) with a smart contract locked and burned  into a dedicated piece of hardware. This has the ability to allow a virtual electrical power generation network, which contributes its resources to the tangible electrical grid. Validation of contribution using trustless proof nodes that allow for the tokenization of electrical energy. All participating nodes are able to mint new CEC (Conscious Energy Chain) tokens that represent electrical power fairly with a proof of contribution consensus protocol. It also incentivizes the use of cheap and renewable energy companies to develop rapidly using public governance CEC funds. This block chain can also mitigate the power consumption costs of other proof of work chains with the use of electrical power contribution network rewards. 
Problems to solve: 
-Develop an oracle that reads data securely
-Develop smart contracts to read time stamped data for network fee/return consensus. 
-Consensus protocol must issue rewards according to the amount contributed, verified by a Smart Contract with a dedicated hardware. 
(The greatest challenge is in the R&D for a  tamper proof energy IoT wallet that is spoof-proof. This also includes line transmission signal verification.)
Introduction:
The general public are typically unable to sell their electrical power back to the local power grid at a fair market price. In these energy markets, small contributors to the energy grid have very little say on the bidding for new centralized power generation sites, yet are often being footed for the bill with local tax. For both these reasons, many distributed renewable energy markets are restrained in technological development and centralized with self interested parties only.
  This makes it challenging for a fair and equal energy network. 
A solution to the problems stated above is the proposition of this whitepaper. It starts by establishing a fair start DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that operates on a proof of contribution protocol. The consensus protocol rewards a hardware node which contributes the most power via a secure hardware data read. 



Proof of Contribution:
Proof of Contribution is a novel approach to consensus protocols. By using this consensus protocol, a network can become secure by contributing their data and computational power. Using a locked sensor to read data sets as a hardware wallet which issues block rewards that can be a dynamic way to subsidize energy utility.  The hardware wallet (nodes) with the highest sensor data energy monitor reads are given the greatest reward.

Systemic problems in the energy network:
Centralized points of failure
In-Efficiency in electrical energy balance
Universally un-fair prices on electrical energy
No incentives for energy surplus, storage, or microgeneration
Very little public consensus on power generation contracts and proposals
Social Contract
This is a group effort to make the energy sector more efficient by applying technological advancements in computer networks. Helping incentivize an emergent and distributed human collective mind on the energy sector, we will be able to build a fair energy utility for all. This will also help Bitcoin, and other proof of work protocols, have extra financial incentive to run more efficiently. There is no possible way one person can achieve this alone nor should it be the responsibility of a single group. The structure of the Foundation's purpose is to become obsolete once the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is founded.   The foundation will be established to all who add to its energy pool by sweat or currency. This will fund the creation of CECF (Conscious Energy Chain Foundation) which will be swapped and burned on the governance decisions of the CEC foundation's direction or held as contributional nostalgia. 
Methodology
The scope of this White paper is to lay a clear framework for the Conscious Energy Chain network. I am not a computer scientist and the solutions presented need to be engineered and tested thoroughly. The layer 0 protocol is still undecided for the solution as considerations of the trilemma (Speed, Scale, Security) in a decentralized blockchain network. 

A Proof of Contribution protocol involves an NFT issued block and sensor ID to be generated when a person activates their minor/energy monitor. A data read condition must be met before the issuing of new blocks in which the NFT sensor confirms a healthy network contributor. 




Tokenomics
Financing-
-Community liquidity pool for DAO financing and Foundation Costs (Legal)
-Fair Start mining when open sourced prototype is complete on lightweight device i.e Raspberry Pi 
(Open source and CE chain specific is a must for the purposes of decentralization)
-Coin burn governance for project proposals
-Bitcoin and other proof of work mining operations incentivized marketplace
